 * An API for building Noise protocols. Noise protocols are lightweight encrypted stream protocols in which you
 * configure your preferred combination of handshakes, negotiations, modes and ciphers to build a protocol
 * customised for your needs. Thus it isn't an out of the com.r3.noise.box replacement for TLS but can be useful in cases
 * where you don't need or want full TLS compatibility.
